		#UTW_OrangeMatterTank_Title = Utility Weight "OS-M" 
		#UTW_OrangeMatterTank_Desc = Long time ago one bright mind took Osmium, the most heavy metal on Kerbin, and forced it to listen heavy metal. Osmium become almost 20 times heavier, no-one sure why. While it easy to produce, it has lack of stiffness and stability, so it never was used in manufacture. Agility of Mortimer Kerman allows him to get some for free, and because it's free and very dense, Linus decide to build Test Weights for lifters â€” small tank simulates up to 500 tonn of cargo!

	//"Orange Matter"
	// Long ago Kerbal scientists discovered Orange Matter with changing mass and for a long time nobody could figure out what to do with the stuff. That is until The Cult were able to stabilize and to control Orange Matter. Throuth it's still useless, and scattered everywhere on the surface of Kerbin.
